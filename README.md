# Selenium_Python-Class_Practicals

This project utilizes Selenium with Python to automate the basic functionalities of browser interactions. It is a part of academic practical assignment assigned by the subject faculty and provides the introduction of many functionalities and explains how the selenium can be used to automate different kind of tasks in different test scenarios.


## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python version 2.7, 3.5 or later installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   pip install selenium [other_dependencies]
Download the appropriate WebDriver for your chosen browser.
Place the WebDriver executable in a directory accessible by your system's PATH environment variable. For example, on Windows, you might add it to C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[version]\Scripts (adjust the path based on your Python installation).


**Usage:**

* To execute your python script simply type "python <file_path/file_name.py> in terminal".

Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

Run the main script using the following command:

Bash
python main.py [arguments]
Use code with caution.
Replace <file_name>.py with the actual name of your main script.


## Examples

Here's an example of how to automate login to a website:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Replace with your browser's WebDriver
driver.get("https://www.example.com/login")

username_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")
username_field.send_keys("your_username")

password_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
password_field.send_keys("your_password")

login_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_button")
login_button.click()
```
